First wanted to get a corpus together
	-did search but didn't turn up much
	-loosened up search terms
	-started getting results that sounded inspirational...
	-made me think of the #blessed hashtag and Twitter, so searched Twitter
	-jackpot

Tried to do Keras / Tensorflow, but couldn't get it working with the el Capitan dynamic file paths...after a couple of hours of research decided not to try

Wanted to see what I could do with it, so tried Markov javascript thing
Seemed like a lot of work...looked around found / remembered Rita.js
Got it working
Needed more material though
Seems like an inspirational thing of "dollar and a dream" is what a lot of people living the precariat lifestyle tell themselves as comfort
Took an excerpt from the intro to The Precariat: the New Dangerous Class( https://www.hse.ru/data/2013/01/28/1304836059/Standing.%20The_Precariat__The_New_Dangerous_Class__-Bloomsbury_USA(2011).pdf)

seemed ok, but thought I might try enforcing PoS structure
made the text entry part
this made me think of trees (because of the backtracking etc)
